For the user's input, please carefully judge whether the following legal provisions are directly applicable or highly relevant to the case.

User input: {{ input_text }}

Candidate legal provisions:
{% for cap in candidate_caps %}
    - {{ cap }}
{% endfor %}

Are the above legal provisions directly applicable or highly relevant to the user's input?

Please respond with a list, where each item is either 'directly_applicable', 'highly_relevant', or 'not_relevant' for the corresponding legal provision. Format example: ['directly_applicable', 'highly_relevant', 'not_relevant', ...]
Only select 'directly_applicable' if the legal provision can be directly applied to resolve the case described in the user input. Select 'highly_relevant' if the legal provision is highly pertinent but may require some interpretation or additional analysis to apply. Select 'not_relevant' if the legal provision does not have a strong connection to the user's input.

First thoroughly analyze each candidate legal provision, then provide your consolidated answer.
