Task:
1. Compare each step of the generated reasoning against the referenced court reasoning
2. Each signal <PRM> in the generated reasoning represents one reasoning step
3. Rate each step for signal <PRM> with "+" (beneficial) or "-" (harmful)
4. Provide your evaluation in a Python list format

Example Output:
["-", "-", "+", ...]
